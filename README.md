# Final349

I used the code from the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial to modify it into the Game of Nim. The Game of Nim is similar to a game of pick-up-sticks, where there are two players and each player must pick up at least one stick when it is their turn. The player who picks up the last stick is the loser.

I only included the index.js file and the index.css files of my mini-app, because those are the only two files that I had made changes to. These two files are located in the src folder.
